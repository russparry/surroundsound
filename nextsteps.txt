Ok here's the problem, the localhost:3000 link refused to load on my computer. Theres a good chance something is wrong there. Also I don't need to implement the supabase and stripe stuff just yet. let's focus more on functionability, also, how will I be able to test the product on multiple devices with just a localhost link? 
I can push this stuff to github and then access github from different devices?

Also there's the problem of authentication from spotify and access tokens. 

Look through this website and these categories on the site https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk : Getting started

The site mentions an access token, it looks like i can get a temporary access token for an hour. When making the file point me to where I should put the access token.

Also I am not as familiar with all the language on this website so I may need to be walked through this process step by step and clarified on what they are requiring from me as a spotify user.
