Analyze my project structure and provide:
1. A complete list of all directories and their purposes
2. The role of each major file in the codebase
3. Which files are frontend, backend, configuration, or deployment-related
4. A count of total lines of code (excluding dependencies/node_modules)

Format this as a clear outline I can reference and save it as a new markdown file called code-base-analysis.md. Explain things simply to a brand new beginner who is on a fast track to becoming a world class engineer.
